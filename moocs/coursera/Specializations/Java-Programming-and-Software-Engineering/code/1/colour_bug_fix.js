/* A solution to part 2 of "Programming Exercise: Advanced Modifying Images" from Week 2
 * By A. S. Ahmann <hackermaneia@riseup.net>
 * - https://github.com/Alekseyyy
 *
 * The Problem: "Your friend is trying to write a program that draws a square 200 pixels by 
 * 200 pixels and that looks like this square with colors red (red value 255), green (green 
 * value 255), blue (blue value 255) and magenta (red value 255 and blue value 255). All 
 * other RGB values are set to 0. [...] Your friend has written code to try to solve this problem, 
 * however their code has a bug [...] Your task is to find and fix the bug. Use what you have learned 
 * about applying the scientific method to debugging: gather information, apply your knowledge 
 * about images and programming, form a hypothesis, test your hypothesis, and finally, change the code 
 * to fix the problem."
