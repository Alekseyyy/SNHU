## Extracurricular Activities

Outside of school, I like to "stay sharp" by doing computer science practice with sundry textbook problems, and work on (semi-)arbitrary computing problems. I also like to dabble in other STEM and humanities related fields. These are some of the results from my extracurricular activities:

<details>
<summary>Open Source Society University (OSSU)</summary>

A significant educational project that I am working on is a (unaccredited, but cheap) set of STEM "majors" from the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu) - abbreviated to _OSSU_. This includes all of my other non-accredited coursework that may or may not be in the OSSU curriculum.
