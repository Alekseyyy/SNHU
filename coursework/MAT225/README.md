> "_Calculus is the mathematical study of change that has widespread applications in science, engineering, economics, and business. This course provides a rigorous introduction to single-variable calculus. Topics include limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of algebraic, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, applications of derivatives, and integration, including the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This course will encourage students to think beyond memorizing formulas and to work towards understanding concepts._" ---[MAT-225 Syllabus](./syllabus.pdf)

## (Re-)discoveries

When taking this class, I made a few tools to assist in solving certain given problems. Some of them are:

* _A modulus pattern formula for computing the derivative ``f^(w)`` for sine and cosine functions given an arbitrarily large **w** :_ [Modulus_Pattern_Formula_Trig_Functions.pdf](./papers/Modulus_Pattern_Formula_Trig_Functions.pdf).

## Resources

_Southern New Hampshire University_ operates in terms of quarter semesters. Typical universities in America have their semesters that last for sixteen (16) weeks, but SNHU's "quarter semesters" last for only eight (8) weeks. Each week consists of a module discussing a part of the subject topics taught in the class.

These modules typically come with resources to assist students with their learning - which I will list here for my reference, and hopefully to assist other students taking a calculus I course: be they at SNHU, another university, or even just self-studying. 

#### OpenStax Textbook

The primary resource, and mechanism by which to demonstrate competence and submit coursework, for the __MAT-225: Calculus I__ course is a custom version of the _OpenStax Volume I_ \([Oct. 8, 2025 archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20251008193700/https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Calculus_Volume_1_-_WEB_68M1Z5W.pdf)\) delivered by the [Möbius online textbook platform](https://www.digitaled.com/mobius/).
