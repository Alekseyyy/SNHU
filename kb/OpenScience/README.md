## Players in the "Alternative" Science Space

These are individuals or institutions that work independent of mainstream science - with some of them contradicting the mainstream. __NOTE:__ that my listing of these "alt science" entities is not an endorsement of their work (in fact, usually I either disagree or I am agnostic of their work). I list them here because I find them interesting, and maybe, just maybe, they can add positive value to society in their own way. 

They also serve as excellent case studies regarding the [Demarcation Problem](https://iep.utm.edu/pseudoscience-demarcation/): which is the philosophical question of how to go about seperating good science from pseudoscience. We should try to abide by the following aphorism: "keep an open mind, just not to the point that your brain falls out."
