## Room Grouping

### Learning Pathway

These are a curation of rooms that I completed (or intend to complete) that meets the requirements for a certification in a subject matter:

<details>
<summary>Red Teaming</summary>

* __Red Team Fundamentals:__ Learn the core components of a red team engagement, from threat intelligence to OPSEC and C2s.
    * ~~[Red Team Fundamentals]()~~: Learn about the basics of a red engagement, the main components and stakeholders involved, and how red teaming differs from other cyber security engagements.
    * ~~[Red Team Engagements]()~~: Learn the steps and procedures of a red team engagement, including planning, frameworks, and documentation.
    * ~~[Red Team Threat Intel]()~~: Apply threat intelligence to red team engagements and adversary emulation.
    * ~~[Red Team OPSEC]()~~: Learn how to apply Operations Security (OPSEC) process for Red Teams.
    * ~~[Intro to C2]()~~: Learn the essentials of Command and Control to help you become a better Red Teamer and simplify your next Red Team assessment!
* __Initial Access:__ Explore the different techniques to gain initial access to a target system and network from a Red Teamer’s perspective.
    * ~~[Red Team Recon]()~~: Learn how to use DNS, advanced searching, Recon-ng, and Maltego to collect information about your target.
    * ~~[Weaponization]()~~: Understand and explore common red teaming weaponization techniques. You will learn to build custom payloads using common methods seen in the industry to get initial access.
    * ~~[Password Attacks]()~~: This room introduces the fundamental techniques to perform a successful password attack against various services and scenarios.
    * ~~[Phishing]()~~: Learn what phishing is and why it's important to a red team engagement. You will set up phishing infrastructure, write a convincing phishing email and try to trick your target into opening your email in a real-world simulation.
* __Post Compromise:__ Learn about the steps taken by an attacker right after gaining an initial foothold on a network.
    * ~~[The Lay of the Land]()~~: Learn about and get hands-on with common technologies and security products used in corporate environments; both host and network-based security solutions are covered.
    * ~~[Enumeration]()~~: This room is an introduction to enumeration when approaching an unknown corporate environment.
    * ~~[Windows Privilege Escalation]()~~: Learn the fundamentals of Windows privilege escalation techniques.
    * ~~[Windows Local Persistence]()~~: Learn the most common persistence techniques used on Windows machines.
    * ~~[Lateral Movement and Pivoting]()~~: Learn about common techniques used to move laterally across a Windows network.
    * ~~[Data Exfiltration]()~~: An introduction to Data Exfiltration and Tunneling techniques over various protocols.
* __Host Evasions:__ Understand the techniques behind host-based security and bypass the most common security products in Windows operating systems.
    * ~~[Windows Internals]()~~: Learn and understand the fundamentals of how Windows operates at its core.
    * ~~[Introduction to Windows API]()~~: Learn how to interact with the win32 API and understand its wide range of use cases.
    * ~~[Abusing Windows Internals]()~~: Leverage windows internals components to evade common detection solutions, using modern tool-agnostic approaches.
    * ~~[Introduction to Antivirus]()~~: Understand how antivirus software works and what detection techniques are used to bypass malicious file checks.
    * ~~[AV Evasion: Shellcode]()~~: Learn shellcode encoding, packing, binders, and crypters.
    * ~~[Obfuscation Principles]()~~: Leverage tool-agnostic software obfuscation practices to hide malicious functions and create unique code.
    * ~~[Signature Evasion]()~~: Learn how to break signatures and evade common AV, using modern tool-agnostic approaches.
    * ~~[Bypassing UAC]()~~: Learn common ways to bypass User Account Control (UAC) in Windows hosts.
    * ~~[Runtime Detection Evasion]()~~: Learn how to bypass common runtime detection measures, such as AMSI, using modern tool-agnostic approaches.
    * ~~[Evading Logging and Monitoring]()~~: Learn how to bypass common logging and system monitoring, such as ETW, using modern tool-agnostic approaches.
    * ~~[Living Off the Land]()~~: Learn the essential concept of "Living Off the Land" in Red Team engagements.
* __Network Security Evasion:__ Learn how to bypass and evade different security solutions used in the industry, such as firewalls and IDS/IPS.
    * ~~[Network Security Solutions]()~~: Learn about and experiment with various IDS/IPS evasion techniques, such as protocol and payload manipulation.
    * ~~[Firewalls]()~~: Learn about and experiment with various firewall evasion techniques, such as port hopping and port tunneling.
    * ~~[Sandbox Evasion]()~~: Learn about active defense mechanisms Blue Teamers can deploy to identify adversaries in their environment.
* __Compromising Active Directory:__ Learn and exploit Active Directory networks through core security issues stemming from misconfigurations.
    * ~~[Active Directory Basics]()~~: This room will introduce the basic concepts and functionality provided by Active Directory.
    * ~~[Breaching Active Directory]()~~: This network covers techniques and tools that can be used to acquire that first set of AD credentials that can then be used to enumerate AD.
    * ~~[Enumerating Active Directory]()~~: This room covers various Active Directory enumeration techniques, their use cases as well as drawbacks.
    * ~~[Lateral Movement and Pivoting]()~~: Learn about common techniques used to move laterally across a Windows network.
    * ~~[Exploiting Active Directory]()~~: Learn common AD exploitation techniques that can allow you to reach your goal in an AD environment.
    * ~~[Persisting Active Directory]()~~: Learn about common Active Directory persistence techniques that can be used post-compromise to ensure the blue team will not be able to kick you out during a red team exercise.
    * ~~[Credentials Harvesting]()~~: Apply current authentication models employed in modern environments to a red team approach.

## Appendix: Comprehensive list of labs done

These are (hopefully) a full list of TryHackMe rooms (or labs) that I finished, find interesting and intend to do later, are in progress, or some combination of the other aforementioned states. The embedded links in the name of the room point to a "resource folder" of notes that I took while doing the room, and the respective room's materials.
