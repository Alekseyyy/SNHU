On the 8th and 9th of February 2025, I attended the <a href="https://www.ourfa2m2.org/" target="_blank">OURFA<sup>2</sup>M<sup>2</sup></a> virtual, and free, mathematics conference, which discusses maths from a "lefty" perspective. I attended them _as a viewer, not as a speaker_, and these are just some interesting takeaways from what I learnt from their seminars.

## Seminars that I attended

I only briefly attended this seminar, not all the way to the end, but I figured that I'd share the links that they shared while there:

* The slides to this presentation: https://people.clas.ufl.edu/henry-adams/files/AnIntroductionToAppliedTopology_Slides_ReducedSize.pdf
* Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network: https://www.aatrn.net/
    * Their YouTube channel (I think?): https://www.youtube.com/@aatrn
