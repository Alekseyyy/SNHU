# Matter and Interactions: Fourth Edition

Rhett Allain<sup>\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]</sup> is a physicist and science educator. He recommended a textbook called _Matter & Interactions_<sup>\[6\]</sup> (ISBN-13: 978-1118875865) which is unique in the sense that in addition to its typical problem sets involving pencil and paper, it also has Python programming problem sets. These are my solutions to some<sup>\[7\]</sup> of its problems.
