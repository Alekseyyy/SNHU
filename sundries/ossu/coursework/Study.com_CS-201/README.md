## Coding Projects

### Assignment 1: The Binary Search Tree

This is a solution to the assignment prompt given by [Study.com (n.d.)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/binary-trees-applications-implementation.html), where I implement a binary search tree that can store data in nodes (note that I use "node" and "data" interchangeably in the code), insert new data/nodes, and delete unwanted data/nodes.

Project Files: [Assignment1](./projects/Assignment1)

### Assignment 2: Boyer-Moore Search Algorithm

This is a solution to the assignment prompt given by [Study.com (n.d.-d)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/computer-science-201-assignment-2-searching-text-string-data.html), where I implement the _Boyer-Moore Search Algorithm_ to efficiently find substrings in a text corpus. This utility outputs the index/position where the substring is located.
