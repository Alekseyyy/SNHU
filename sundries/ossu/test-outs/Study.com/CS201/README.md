### Assignment 1: The Binary Search Tree

The following is a showcase for [Assignment 1: The Binary Search Tree](./Assignment1). This is a solution to the assignment prompt given by [Study.com (n.d.)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/binary-trees-applications-implementation.html), where I implement a binary search tree that can store data in nodes (note that I use "node" and "data" interchangeably in the code), insert new data/nodes, and delete unwanted data/nodes.
