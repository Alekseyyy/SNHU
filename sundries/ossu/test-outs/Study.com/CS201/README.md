### Assignment 1: The Binary Search Tree

The following is a showcase for [Assignment 1: The Binary Search Tree](./Assignment1). This is a solution to the assignment prompt given by [Study.com (n.d.)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/binary-trees-applications-implementation.html), where I implement a binary search tree that can store data in nodes (note that I use "node" and "data" interchangeably in the code), insert new data/nodes, and delete unwanted data/nodes.

#### Usage (and video demonstration)

An ``assignment1.jar`` file is located in the ``Assignment1`` folder (filenames/folder names are case sensitive). To use the utility, simply open up the terminal, ``cd`` into the ``Assignment1`` folder and run ``java --jar assignment1.jar``

The following is a video footage demonstrating the binary search tree - ``assignment1.jar`` - in action:

#### Codebase

* The ``Assignment1`` folder contains the Eclipse IDE project files that I used to create ``assignment1.jar``. The following are the two key ``.java`` source code files that I wrote 

* ``MyBinaryTree.java`` ( [here](./Assignment1/src/assignment/MyBinaryTree.java) ) contains ``MyBinaryTree`` - which is the ``public class`` that makes up the more abstract data type that is my custom binary search tree.
    * Note that when implementing the binary search tree, I cited several "Study.com" ([n.d.](https://study.com/academy/lesson/binary-trees-applications-implementation.html), [n.d.-b](https://study.com/academy/lesson/practical-application-for-data-structures-search-trees.html), [n.d.-c](https://study.com/academy/lesson/data-structures-algorithms-assignment-array-sorting-and-hashmaps.html) lessons and "Geeks4Geeks" ([c.a. Oct. 21, 2024](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-traversal-of-binary-tree/), [c.a. Oct. 30, 2024](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preorder-traversal-of-binary-tree/), [c.a. Oct. 21, 2024b](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/postorder-traversal-of-binary-tree/), [c.a. Dec. 5, 2024](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deletion-in-binary-search-tree/) ) tutorials, and integrated their code into my project.
* ``Program.java`` ( [here](./Assignment1/src/assignment/Program.java) ) is the driver that calls the ``MyBinaryTree`` abstract data type to demonstrate its features.
